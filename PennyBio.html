    <p>I have always lived in Texas and I am a true Southern girl.  You will figure that out after a few seconds of hearing me speak.  My southern draw is more of an East Texas twang, even though I call Austin my home since 1996. Austin is much more progressive than than the little town I grew up in. The cultural mix of beautiful accents I have been surrounded with since I have been in Austin has not managed to rub off on me much.  I still sound like I am from that little town 40 miles northeast of Houston.  
    <br>
    <p>I fell and love and got married in 1991, and in 1996, we moved from Spring to Austin where I worked as an Aviation Insurance Broker and continued my education at University of Texas.  After graduating with a B.S. in Communications, I had twins; a boy and a girl. I quit work for a while to focus on raising the babies.  With twins, the money we would have paid for daycare didn't provide us with enough left over in my salary to justify continuing work, so it was an easy choice.  In 2006, once the twins started kindergarden, I started a career as a technical writer contracting with the State of Texas.  In 2012, I had another baby and quit work for about 3 months and then started contracting again with the State on a part-time basis.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy many passions.  I have been learning from, mentoring and encouraging other women since 2007. In 2009, I began leading a weekly women's group where we share our burdens, and learn to encourage and build one another one up in love. It is a beautiful environment where we can grow in our relationship with God, with each other and with others. I also work with high school students.  I lead a group of 11th grade girls each week.  I also lead high school students on summer mission trips where we have the honor of stepping outside of ourselves and serving others who are often overlooked and desperately in need of love, resources and encouragement.  Each summer with the about 300 middle school and high school students pile on busses for 24 hours to spend a week in Estes Park, Colorado.  It's like summer camp and it is more fun than you can imagine!</p>
